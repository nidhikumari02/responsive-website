            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Transformation of Education System in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Indian Education system is often scrutinized by all the stakeholders. Students complain that the system tests their memory and not their intelligence; parents complain about the system promoting nothing but a rat race; teachers complaining about students not catching up with the syllabus. But if we all stop for a moment and look back into why we are learning the way we are and how we have adapted to the global trend, the white noise vanishes.
              We were and are considered to be the beacon of light, the centre of learning since ancient times. As said before, to eliminate the white noise we should understand how we got here. Unlike the Occident, there was something very unique about the way education was taking place back here in India.
              Just like how the executive, judiciary, and the legislature can’t interfere with each other in their daily affairs today, education was something that was far from the influence of the state and society. Children had to stay with the teacher in the Gurukul leaving their homes to acquire knowledge. The teacher took care of the children who came to learn under him by providing everything including clothing, food, and shelter. No fee was collected from them.
              The whole idea of education was focused on the enrichment of culture, character, and personality, development, and cultivation of noble ideals. The objective was to gain mental, physical, and intellectual toughness, to make the students future-ready and survive in any situation.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education was a platform of interactive academic co-existence amongst scholars of diverse specializations. This was to facilitate the convergence of disciplines and transactional mutuality of holistic wisdom. The Gurukulas were the epitome of experiential learning; they thrived in all aspects of our heritage, culture, arts, drama, music, and archaeology. Since there were no books back then, teaching was basically via orals and debates.
              But during the time of British rule, there were primarily two motives - plundering the wealth of this land and the 'white man's burden ' of civilizing the natives (the term used by them to refer to all Indians). This made a huge dent in our Education systems drilling a black hole with distorted narratives and rote learning methods.
              Reminds me of a quote from Swami Vivekanand Ji , “With a strong character, the strength of mind and only then the intellect is expanded, and only by which one can stand on one’s own feet. One gets real knowledge”.
              Though real Knowledge is the supreme power, what’s the role of education? Education has always been a very contextual subject, between what students need to learn and what a student desires to learn. But it’s extremely crucial either way for education to help an individual find a meaningful place in society. Mere accumulation of basic wisdom is of limited practical use unless it is translated into innovations, providing economic or social value. It is the transfer of knowledge for economic growth that impacts society at large, which has revolutionized this world.
              In our education system, we have more than 265 million children in school (1-12 Grades), 35 million young adults studying in 1000+ Universities, 56000 colleges with a GER of 26%, which is around 8 million youth graduating every year. This makes our country one of the largest university systems in the world, no system has grown at this proportion. This is also what we call India’s Youth dividend.
